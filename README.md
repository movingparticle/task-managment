# Task Manager App

This simple command-line app now supports binary attachments for tasks.

A lightweight HTML interface has been added (see `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`).
It stores tasks in the browser using `localStorage`, so you can copy the files into
CodePen or any static host and manage tasks in the browser.
