# Task Manager App

This project is a simple task manager built only with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Tasks are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage` so you can copy the
files to any static host or even CodePen and manage your tasks without a server.

The interface has three tabs for organising tasks:

* **Importantes**
* **Diarias**
* **Anuales**

Each task lets you set a start and end date and an optional attachment. Use the
tabs to switch between categories and view only the tasks for that section.
